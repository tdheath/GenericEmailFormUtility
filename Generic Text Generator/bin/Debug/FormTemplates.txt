Sample Form
This is a sample form. The first line is read as the title of the form and will not appear
anywhere other than in the application, for identifying each form. For a form item, 
put it within the text with square brackets.For a form
element called 'sample', it can be put in like this: [sample].
Be sure to end each form with a tilde. This allows the reader to differentiate between each form.
